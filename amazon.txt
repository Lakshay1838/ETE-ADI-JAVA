EC2 - Scalable virtual servers. Charged based on resources of the virtual servers (RAM, CPU, storage), per hour. Servers 
        can change their resource allocation but must be restarted to apply them.

Elastic Beanstalk - Ties together EC2, RDS and Elastic Load Balancing with simple configuration and deployment. Its 
    primary advantage is how it can facilitate the autoscaling of EC2 instances. Billing is based on a combination of the 
    EC2, RDS and ELB that you use. Deployment is made easy with CLI tools, and we can use rolling deployments so there is no downtime. It has support for several languages including Python, NodeJS, Java and Go.

RDS-
Relational database hosting platform. Charged in the same way as EC2 (i.e. a virtual machine with a set amount of 
resources). Servers can be resized but must be restarted to do so.
